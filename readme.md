```
Fetch words from the search database cluster:

const getWords = async () => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      try {
        const res = await axios.get(`${endPoints.url1}allWords`);
        const results = await res.data;
        resolve(results);
        if (!results.state) {
          throw new Error(results.state);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        reject(err.response.data);
      }
    });
  };

Make a batch-upload from your favorite in-browser database e.g(indexedDB, localStorage) to search
to search or dictionary database cluster.
  
  const batchUpload = async (data = [], constant = "") => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      try {
        const res = await axios.post(`${endPoints.url2}${constant}`, data);
        const results = await res.data;
        resolve(results);
      } catch (err) {
        reject(err.response.data);
      }
    });
  };
